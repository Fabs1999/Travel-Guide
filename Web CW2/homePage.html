            <p><b>Sevilla</b> is the capital of Andalusia, the Autonomous Community with the largest population in
                Spain, the
                fourth most populous city in the country, and one of the most important capitals of Southern Europe.</p>
            <p>In the past, <b>Sevilla</b> was the most important city in the world!</p>
            <p>I visited a couple of years ago and fell in love with this city! The weather is beautiful, the people are
                mega friendly, and drinks are cheap haha.</p>

            <p><b>Toulon</b> is a port city on Southern France's Mediterranean coast, lined with sandy beaches and
                shingle
                coves.</p>
            <p>It's a significant naval base and the harbour is home to submarines and warships, as well as fishing
                boats and ferries.</p>
            <p>This is my personal favourite. My partner lives there, so I usually go 10-11 times a year, and it became
                my second home. The food there is amazing, and the weather is stunning!</p>

            <h2>Nice, France</h2>

            </figure>
            <p><b>Nice</b> is the capital of the Alpes-Maritimes department on the French Riviera, sitting on the pebbly
                shore
                of the Baie des Anges.</p>
            <p>Founded by the Greeks and later a retreat for 19th-century European elite, the city has long attracted
                artists.</p>
            <p>I have been there a few times. This is a proper big city, but it does have the same feeling as Toulon.
                The food is good, the weather is great, and the beaches are an eye-catcher!</p>
